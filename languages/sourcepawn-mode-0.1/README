This is an emacs major mode for SourcePawn plugin development. It has
Pawn syntax aware code highlighting, in addition to highlighting of
SourceMode-specific constants and function names.

It is licensed under the GNU GPL v3. See `LICENSE` for details.

If you have downloaded this as an archive from the internet, chances
are there is a file named `sourcepawn-mode.el` in this directory.  The
comments at the top of this file will tell you how to install it.

If you downloaded this from my git repository, or if
`sourcepawn-mode.el` does not exist, you can generate it. Copy all of
the SourcePawn include files into `sp-include`, then run `make`. This
will scan the include files for constant and function names, then
generate optimized regular expressions, then copy these expressions
into `proto-sourcepawn-mode.el`, thereby creating `sourcepawn-mode.el`.
